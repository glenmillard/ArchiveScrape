# Archive Scrape Script(s)

This script scrapes the archive.org webpage for my fave magazine from my youth. 
It's a start. I want to add more to the script later.

It will print out the title, publication year and month of each of the Heavy Metal mags on the archive.org
site. It's messy, but I want to clean it up a little.
This was to teach myself web scraping!

Next step - save the results into a searchable format (CSV, SQL data, Excel file, etc)
